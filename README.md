# nullThrows

It really seems like the `T` should be capitalized, so now it is. (`null-throws` on npm)

Created by [jones](https://github.com/jonesnxt) @ [Subsecond](https://www.getsubsecond.com).
Based on the [`nullthrows`](https://github.com/zertosh/nullthrows) library by [zertosh](https://github.com/zertosh).

A [flow](https://flowtype.org) typed utility that accepts `value` (e.g. `nullThrows(value)`) and throws if `value` is `null` or `undefined`, otherwise it returns `value`.
